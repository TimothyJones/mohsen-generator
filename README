This project was created in the course of some research I am/was doing. It is uploaded here for

  * My own personal reference
  * Research integrity

In that order. It is not intended for general use, and is probably a good example of a write-only, I-am-in-a-hurry style. 

That said, if you want to use it for any purpose, I'll very likely licence it to you. You can contact me at timothy.l.jones@gmail.com
